## Professional Self-Assessment

Completing the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University has allowed me to develop a comprehensive set of technical and professional skills. The CS 499 Capstone and my ePortfolio showcase this growth through enhanced artifacts that demonstrate my expertise in software design, algorithms, data structures, and databases.

- Software Design and Engineering: My enhanced Java-based Contact Management system reflects my ability to design and implement object-oriented solutions. I strengthened input validation, exception handling, and professional documentation while expanding unit testing to cover edge cases, ensuring reliability and maintainability.

- Algorithms and Data Structures: The C++ OpenGL graphics application highlights my command of algorithmic principles. I implemented real-time camera control, dynamic projection toggling, and event-driven input handling, demonstrating skill in managing complex state and applying mathematical operations in graphics programming.

- Databases: The interactive animal shelter dashboard illustrates my ability to integrate front-end applications with MongoDB. Enhancements included dynamic filtering, interactive visualizations, and secure database interactions, showcasing full-stack development skills and user-focused design.

Throughout the Capstone, I also worked on communication and collaboration skills. Creating clear narratives, detailed documentation, and a professional code review video allowed me to express my design decisions effectively.

Enhancing these artifacts stregthened the importance of problem-solving, maintainable code, and secure practices. I developed a security-conscious approach through input validation and careful data handling, while debugging and testing taught me how to carefully repeat on complex systems.

This ePortfolio represents not only the technical skills I have accomplished but also my readiness to contribute professionally in the software industry. It demonstrates my ability to incorporate multiple areas of computer science into practical solutions, communicate effectively, and continuously improve as a developer. I am confident that these experiences have prepared me to deliver value in any technology-driven environment and continue growing.
