## 1. Artifact Description
This artifact is an **interactive dashboard web application** developed in CS-340. It connects to a **MongoDB database** simulating an animal shelterâ€™s rescue records, allowing users to filter, explore, and visualize data on different rescue types, animal breeds, and locations through an integrated map.


## 2. Justification for Inclusion
I included this artifact because it demonstrates critical skills in **database integration, data visualization, and full-stack development**.  

Key components demonstrating my skills:  
- Using a custom CRUD Python module to securely interact with a **NoSQL database**.  
- Implementing **interactive data filtering** that dynamically updates tables, charts, and maps.  
- Building responsive, user-friendly dashboards with **Dash components** and **Leaflet maps**.  

Enhancements made:  
- Completed filtering logic and restored pie chart visualization linked to filtered data.  
- Improved map updates to accurately reflect user row selections.  
- Removed placeholder code and polished the UI with a professional logo and layout.


## 3. Enhancements & Alignment with Course Outcomes
Enhancements strengthened my ability to:  
- Design and implement **interactive, database-driven applications**.  
- Apply software engineering practices to maintain clean, modular, and maintainable code.  
- Integrate **front-end and back-end components** effectively, synchronizing user interactions with the database.  

**Course outcomes addressed:**  
- Software engineering and design principles for full-stack applications.  
- Database manipulation, including CRUD operations and secure data handling.  
- Data visualization to communicate information effectively to stakeholders.


## 4. Reflection
During the enhancement process, I deepened my understanding of **Dash callback functions** and synchronizing multiple interactive components, including the data table, pie chart, and map, based on user inputs.  

Challenges and key learnings:  
- Managing filtered data and user selections to make sure charts and maps accurately reflect the current state.  
- Debugging callback dependencies helped gain knowledge of **reactive programming** and handling error in Dash.  
- Cleaning up placeholder code early improved maintainability and reduced confusion.  
- Handling MongoDB connections securely and efficiently strengthened my backend development skills.  

Overall, this process emphasized the importance of **modular code, user-centric design**, and **incremental testing**, resulting in a professional-quality, interactive database-driven application.
