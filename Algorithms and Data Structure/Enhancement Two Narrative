## 1. Artifact Description
This artifact is a **C++ OpenGL-based graphics application** consisting primarily of `MainCode.cpp` and the `ViewManager` class (`ViewManager.h` and `ViewManager.cpp`). It was created in December 2024.  

The application:  
- Initializes and manages a 3D rendering context.  
- Handles window creation, user input, and camera controls.  
- Allows toggling between **perspective** and **orthographic** projections for interactive 3D scene visualization.


## 2. Justification for Inclusion
I included this artifact because it demonstrates core skills in **graphics programming**, including system initialization, event-driven programming, and matrix transformations critical to 3D visualization.  

Highlights of skills demonstrated:  
- **ViewManager class**: Implements algorithmic camera movement using mouse input and keyboard controls.  
- **Projection toggling**: Shows ability to handle dynamic user input with linear algebra operations.  
- **Code enhancements**: Added comprehensive comments for clarity, implemented smooth toggling between orthographic and perspective projections, and fixed input processing logic to improve usability and maintainability.


## 3. Enhancements & Alignment with Course Outcomes
Enhancements made:  
- Added detailed comments throughout the code for clarity and maintainability.  
- Implemented toggling between **orthographic** and **perspective** projections.  
- Fixed input processing logic to ensure accurate camera control and smooth user interaction.  

**Course outcomes addressed:**  
- Understanding graphics pipeline management.  
- Applying event-driven programming for real-time 3D navigation.  
- Structuring applications effectively in OpenGL.  
- Strengthening algorithmic thinking for camera movement and projection handling.

Future plans include expanding the project with **complex shader interactions** and advanced scene management techniques.


## 4. Reflection
Enhancing this artifact deepened my understanding of integrating **GLFW input callbacks** with real-time camera control and dynamic projection switching.  

Key learnings:  
- Careful management of global and class-level state variables is critical for smooth interaction.  
- Writing clear, comprehensive comments improves code readability and helps communicate complex OpenGL processes.  
- Making sure that theres smooth projection toggling without disrupting existing computations was a significant challenge.  

Overall, this enhancement strengthened my grasp of **graphics algorithms**, user input handling, and the graphics pipeline in professional software development.
