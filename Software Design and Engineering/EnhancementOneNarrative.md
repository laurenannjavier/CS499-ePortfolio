# Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering

**Author:** Lauren-Ann Javier  
**Course:** CS 499, Southern New Hampshire University  
**Instructor:** Mr. Martinez  
**Date:** 07/17/2025  


## 1. Artifact Description
This artifact is a **Java-based Contact Management system** consisting of four classes: `Contact`, `ContactService`, `ContactTest`, and `ContactServiceTest`. 
It was originally created during my CS 320 class and has been progressively enhanced for this CS 499 Capstone project.

- `Contact`: Represents an individual contact with validated fields for contact ID, first name, last name, phone, and address.  
- `ContactService`: Manages contacts by supporting add, update, delete, and retrieval operations.  
- Test classes: Provide comprehensive unit testing to ensure error-free functionality.


## 2. Justification for Inclusion
I included this artifact because it demonstrates my ability to design and implement **object-oriented systems** that enforce data integrity through **validation, encapsulation, and exception handling**.  

Highlights of skills and abilities demonstrated:  
- `Contact` class: Field validation prevents invalid data entry, an essential software engineering practice.  
- `ContactService` class: Manages collections of objects with meaningful exceptions when operations violate business rules (e.g., adding duplicate contacts).  
- Test classes: Written with JUnit 5 to cover positive and negative test cases, showcasing professional-quality testing.

Enhancements made for this project improved code readability, maintainability, and overall software quality.


## 3. Enhancements & Alignment with Course Outcomes

### Contact Class
- Added detailed **JavaDoc comments** for all methods and fields.  
- Improved exception messages to be more descriptive and consistent.

### ContactService Class
- Added input validation and explicit exception handling for invalid operations.  
- Validated `contactId` parameters to prevent null or empty inputs.  
- Improved JavaDoc documentation.

### ContactTest & ContactServiceTest
- Added descriptive assertion messages to clarify intent and aid debugging.  
- Expanded tests to cover additional edge cases, null inputs, invalid field lengths.  
- Improved test method naming and added JavaDoc-style comments explaining each test’s purpose.

**Course outcomes addressed:**  
- Designing and evaluating computing solutions using software engineering principles.  
- Implementing well-structured, professional-quality code with documentation and testing.  
- Making sure that software quality through comprehensive unit testing.  
- Developing a security mindset by validating inputs to prevent invalid data.


## 4. Reflection
Enhancing this artifact deepened my understanding of software design best practices, **error handling**, and **unit testing**.  

Key takeaways:  
- Input validation is critical for maintaining consistent system state.  
- Clear documentation improves maintainability and readability.  
- Aligning service-layer behavior with test expectations requires careful logic design.  
- Writing comprehensive unit tests for both valid and invalid scenarios improves software reliability.

Challenges faced included ensuring all invalid inputs were handled correctly and making sure exception handling aligned with test expectations. 
Overall, this process strengthened my professional software engineering skills and my ability to deliver high-quality, maintainable code.
